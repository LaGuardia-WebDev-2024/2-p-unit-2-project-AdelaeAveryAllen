<h1><strong>dyslexia</strong></h1>
<h2 id="what1">What is it?</h2>
<p>Let's start with a definition; dyslexia is a a neurobiological learning disability that results in difficulties with language processing, particularly reading, spelling, and writing. This is a life long disability and is caused by  differences in how the brain develpos. It is also gentic and runs in familys.</p>

<h2 id="why1">What does it look like how does it affect people?</h2>
<p>Some symptoms include trouble with decoding (sounding out words), encoding (spelling words), and fluency (reading at a good pace and without mistakes) As well as difficutly processing infomation, sequences, and more. Finally, other common signs are not understanding what you’ve read, making a lot of mistakes when reading, quickly forgetting names of people and places, feeling tired after reading, avoiding reading, and difficulty with spelling and writing. </p>

<h2>Why we need a different aproch!</h2>
<p>It is SO IMPORTANT to note dyslexia does NOT mean dum, are brains just need to be taught in a different way so we can fully process and understand infomation. That is why many dyslexixs have accadations for school. For example, technogy, questions read aload, and extra time. These accommodations help us perform the way we would if we did't have dyslexia. In other words it insures we are accurately assessed.</p>

<h2>Why it is be a super power and not just a disability!</h2>
        <p>Dyslexis tend to havestrong problem-solving skills, excellent spatial awareness, and the ability to see the "big picture", and make connections between unrelated concepts. </p>
